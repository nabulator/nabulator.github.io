    <h1>Stepmania Pad. </h1>
    July 2020

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    I grew up with a game called Dance Dance Revolution at home and cycled through 
    several foam pads. Flimsy fabric ripped easily and pads were not well anchored, often
    drifting during play. Real arcade pads are built from rugged metal frames, came with 
    sturdy bar that supports human weight and are bulky (100kg total). Building your own pads
    provides a balance between portability, sturdiness and price.

    <p>
    There does exist many other hard dance pads you get on the market. Historically, two of
    the best included Cobalt Flux pads and Blue Shark, both which are no longer manufactured 
    and only available through second-hand markets. Stepmaniax pads are also acquirable for
    new although they are pricey ($900+shipping) and somewhat low-stocked.

    <p>
    The primary goals for this build is to:
    <ol>
      <li> Highly sensitive sensors for high stamina play </li>
      <li> Support USB host for PC interface </li>
      <li> Use wood for the frame </li>
      <li> Modular design to allow for arbitrary rearrangement of panels for portability </li>
      <li> Be as cheap as possible while fulfilling requirements 1-4
    </ol>

    <p>
    The source code and documentation needed to reproduce this project is available on the 
    Openpad project on <a href="https://github.com/davleop/openpad">Github</a> 
    originally pioneered by finalarcadia. I have forked and added my own changes. Maybe
    if will submit a PR sometime in the future. Since the details of build are available 
    externally, I will focus on documenting the
    thought process, experimentation and hacks that went on.

    The frame is designed by my longtime friend KJCHU. S
