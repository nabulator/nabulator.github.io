<h1>Travel Pad</h1>

<p>March 2021</p>

<p>A full-sized dance pad can be a bit heavy and unwieldy so why not make a mini
pad. Some people call this a <em>travel pad</em>, which is an acceptable name if you&rsquo;re
already deep in the dance community. A quick search reveals that it&rsquo;s actually
more commonly used to mean cloth pad used to change baby&rsquo;s diapers. Perhaps the
term mini-pad is snappier and memorable.  :D</p>

<p>Unlike a real pad, you can tuck it under your arm pits and carry it like a
skateboard and ride it to the moon.  Portable and functional. Sure, it slips a
bit during playing but nothing a few heavy bricks can&rsquo;t handle. Also, does no
time travel. sorry~</p>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There are so many existing resources on why you would be interested in using
Force-Sensing Resistors. The technology is relatively new, being developed in
1977 and manufactured from the 90s. The operation of the force depends on
<em>quantum tunneling</em>. The main advantage of the sensor is its small size, its
paper thin profile, its low cost and robust operating conditions and its high
sensitivity.  Compared to the load cells
used in <a href="openpad.html">openpad</a>, FSRs are easier to integrate into firmware
with no more than a DC power line (5V) and a single resistor. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>One does not <em>have</em> to use FSRs for a mini pad. One early Travel Pad prototype in
Rembrandt&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ho82WgAU57NnZQTG75v4WbRqosCPmwy7r1IAPUC4vxU/">Guide</a> uses original DDR rubber sensors and metal L-brackets.
However, acquiring these parts may be tricky (finding a
domestic supplier) and more expensive (FSRs are $5 a pop).</p>

<p>My particular build uses FSR. These sensors are sensitive enough to pick up 10g
of force. Reportedly, others have  derived a working pad by simply taping them
to the floor, no strings attached. These kinds of minimal builds certainly &ldquo;do
the job&rdquo; in terms of sensing not to mention the fact that one can achieve a high
performance of play with them, but they don&rsquo;t provide the tactile feedback you
get from a real pad.</p>

<p>The goal of this build was to simply make a travel pad but also permit some
flexibility in making adjustments in the future. It is, at its best, a prototype
meant to permit further experimentation. All the important mechanical parts are
serviceable in that I can arbitrary raise and lower panels, sensors and spacing.
This is something arcade owners (or dance game aficionados) do on a regular
basis anyways so it made sense to build it in as a mechanism. The software side also
permits arbitrary threshold adjustments thanks to <a href="https://github.com/davleop/fsr">Teejusb&rsquo;s UI and firmware</a>.</p>

<p>This write-up follows from my own experiments and is neither definitive nor
comprehensive in its coverage of the topic, although there is an active community
with plenty of detailed guides and information points linked below.</p>

<a name="Frame"></a>
<h2>Frame</h2>

<p>Being a travel pad means that the frame is smaller and easier to build. I made
mine from 2x4 lumber, which is the cheapest one at my local hardware shop. My
dimensions are just a bit smaller than those of Rembrandt, but the width of the
panels are designed to be the same as the width of a flat 2x4 block, which
is about 3 &frac12;". Thus, the construction of the base very simple. Dowel joinery is
used with a jig and base is glued. A full sized solid &frac34;" panel is used as the
center. This center was conveniently left over from the first pad I made. It&rsquo;s
important that the base you fabricate lies flat and does not wobble on the
surface you intend to play on. Alternatively, you can use your pad over some
foam pads or other compressing surface, but this workaround detracts from
its portability.</p>

<p><img src="./img/pad2_justbase.jpg" alt="Bare pad with just the center panel" /></p>

<p>I use screw inserts that drill directly into the wood to mount my center
panel. The center panel is countersunk and uses flat head machine screws (#10-24
or M6, whatever is lying around). I had previously used special bits to tap
threads directly into the wood itself but I wanted to try inserts this time.
It&rsquo;s not clear if one is better than the other for this application but inserts
are faster to install.</p>

<a name="Sensor-Mounts"></a>
<h3>Sensor Mounts</h3>

<p>I use sensor mounts bring the sensor closer to the surface since my panels are
only 3/8" or ~10mm while my center panel rests on top of the base and protrudes
&frac34;" outwards. Using some plywood and some cheap craft foam did the trick to
make give me arbitrary spacing adjustment. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_x7HFaBBUg&amp;list=PL2vUwLUVuyIy4CD8DEwS7oZ_Y41vyYWW/">Dominick</a> takes a similar approach
but uses plastic spacers which are laboriously hand-cut. Props to him for
that.</p>

<p>I wanted adjustable sensor heights because it means I can pretend I am playing
on DDR 3rd Mix cabinet or SMX cabs. Having played on both, I can say I like the
feeling of both! As a relevant side note, I would like to mention that Zetorux
likes the panels to be 3 credit cards lower than the center, which replicates
the kind of feeling you&rsquo;d get on a DDR X2 cabinet <a href="http://davleop.com/jonx_padthick.mp4">[video]</a>. Flush or raised
panels are also possible.</p>

<p><img src="./img/pad2_baseraisers.jpg" alt="Sensor mounts" /></p>

<p>The FSRs have an adhesive on the bottom so I can tape them. A small wooden
popsicle-sized stick is placed above the FSR to make sure <em>only the active
region</em> is contacted. If your popsicle stick is uneven, or if you make custom
thickness, length wooden contacts, you <strong>must</strong> make sure they make a flat,
uniform contact across the <em>active region</em> of the FSR! If your shims are larger
than the area, your sensors will <strong>not</strong> actuate!</p>

<a name="Electronics"></a>
<h2>Electronics</h2>

<p>Pretty straightforward compared to Load cells due to simpler circuits.</p>

<a name="Sensors"></a>
<h3>Sensors</h3>

<p>The sensor form factor I ordered of the
<a href="https://buyinterlinkelectronics.com/">Interlink Shop</a> is the <strong>FSR Model 408 500mm</strong> length with tab terminators.
The substrate the sensor is printed on is rather thin and bendable. Care is
needed to ensure the two contacts don&rsquo;t short &ndash; a proper connector is probably
the best option. Since Interlink failed to send me sensors with the female
terminator (as I had specified in my order), I soldered the damn thing directly
to wires. There exists a method to terminate the sensors with electric tape but
I would not recommend it. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>There are couple of <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/ptm/i/interlink-electronics/force-sensing-resistors--best-practices/tutorial">manufacturer recommendations</a>. But I can give you the
<strong>thick</strong> to <strong>thin</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a firm and flat mounting surface</li>
<li>Use a soft rubber or springy material to actuate</li>
<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> bend, dent or kink</li>
</ul>


<a name="Circuit"></a>
<h3>Circuit</h3>

<p><img src="./img/fsr_curves.png" alt="Some curves showing force vs resistance and voltage reading vs force input for
various resistor types" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Some relevant graphs for force, resistance and voltage readings stolen from the manufacturer</p>

<p>Unlike the load cells which require an amplifier, using FSRs don&rsquo;t strictly
require an external amplifier (as pictured above). A simple voltage divider is
sufficient and used for each of the four sensors. A resistor value of 330 Ω is
recommended but the exact value depends on the sensor and setup.</p>

<p>What our circuit does is give us an output, V_o =  V_in * R_fsr / (R + R_fsr) .</p>

<ul>
<li>The FSR roughly registers 100kΩ when inactive and 1kΩ when 1kg is actuated</li>
<li>There is non-linear response which worsens as you increase the resistance, as
a result of the equation above</li>
</ul>


<p>Below, you can see from the resistor color codes that I am using 470Ω, which is
a tad bit too sensitive and nonlinear for software <a href="https://github.com/davleop/fsr">adjustable thresholds</a>.</p>

<p><img src="./img/pad2_voltage_divider.jpg" alt="A simple voltage divider" /></p>

<p>Perfboards are used because I have those lying around and bread boards are
finicky. This way I can mount them upside down on the bottom of my pad.
JST XH connectors are used for quick disconnects. Still looking for a nice
crimping tool to help me make better connectors. Using pliers is not good
practice and has caused some problems in connectivity.</p>

<p><img src="./img/pad2_transistors.jpg" alt="Some BJT switches" />
Using some BJT (TIP-121) transistors as switches for the lights. I cut up a 5V
1A LED strip into four slices and those are JST XH terminated as well. They are
externally powered by a different USB connector that is dedicated for power.
These are more useful for debugging pad condition in real time.</p>

<a name="Microcontroller"></a>
<h3>Microcontroller</h3>

<p>Wiring is not great, a hole routes to the bottom of the panel where are the
boards are mounted.</p>

<p><img src="./img/pad2_wiring.jpg" alt="Wiring" /></p>

<p>Arduino Leonardo, Teejusb&rsquo;s code. Using my own jank DIY cables to connect to the
arduino which have been bolted the bottom of the center panel. Hopefully,
vibration is not an issue. <em>Yes</em>, I am no longer using scotch tape to secure
my popsicle sticks. I use hot glue and it&rsquo;s not great. A thin sheet of neoprene
rubber or even velcro would be preferable. It&rsquo;s a work in progress after all.
<em>Yes</em>, the wire contacts look like they could short and they did so I ended up
smacking some electric tape in there but heat shrink tubes or more hot glue
would have been more permanent.</p>

<h2>Final Impressions</h2>

<p><img src="./img/pad2_final.jpg" alt="The final pad" /></p>

<p>It works well for stamina and timing, if your movements are minimal. Again, the
primary issue is the small size of the base and panels, which can cause
wobbling if you either step near the edges of the pad causing it to tilt and
shift during play. The supporting panels aren&rsquo;t glued into place, so the pads
are also rather noisy compared to real arcade panels (but less so compared to
pads that aren&rsquo;t balanced &ndash; looking at <em>you</em> 8otb machine).</p>

<p>Playing on carpet is annoying but less so than tiled stone flooring, due to the
excessive movement. Still, not bad for testing out FSRs and finding a
comfortable mechanical adjustments for a desirable final pad build. The
experiment gives me the confidence and experience needed to go full out on the
next prototype.</p>

<a name="Future-Work"></a>
<h2>Future Work</h2>

<p>Building a full sized pads with FSRs, using multiple FSRs, maybe custom PCB,
maybe analog MUX, color RGB lights, modifying firmware for saving levels maybe
in the EEPROM or it&rsquo;s own flash code somehow. Acrylic / polycarbonate panels
with art design, a proper bar (welding?)</p>

<p>Well, everything short of buying an actual manufactured arcade cabinet and pads.

<h3>Bill of Materials</h3>

<p>By popular request, I have complied this table for reference. Note it does not
include any tools I have used including woodworking tools, soldering irons,
crimpers, etc. Because I am lazy, I prioritized using what I had accumulated
from other projects or part bins instead of buying a better more specialized
part.</p>

<p>I hesistate to provide detailed instructions as I want to inspire rather than
instruct. They are definitely alternative and <em>better</em> materials, methods and so
forth, to arrive at an ideal pad. Nonetheless, for people who are just getting
started, this is meant to serve as general guidance. As such, I have ballparked
the prices to give you a reasonable way to play catch in the ball park.</p>

I know that electronic piano keyboards have pressure sensitivity detection
   to simulate loudness dynamics of a real piano&rsquo;s hammer action &ndash; through it&rsquo;s
   strangely titled <em>velocity</em>. Turns out these keyboards don&rsquo;t have a singular
   sensitivity sensor to acquire this data. Instead, there are two contacts in a
   single key which are placed at different distances from the receiver. Thus,
   the firmware literally measures the velocity of the strike by taking the
   different in time and assigning the Note trigger ON a velocity value based on
   that timing difference. Needless to say, this probably won&rsquo;t give us what
   dance players are looking for, a sharp hysteresis curve.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></li>

I had originally seen a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB9hqS_yGLc">video</a> which Youtuber greenTea cuts these
    long sensors into several smaller ones. He then shoves two cables and duct
    tapes them into place in a somewhat jank way. I found that this method of
    termination does not guarantee a strong contact between the wire and sensor. In
    other words, the electrical connection is a weak one and prone to
    disconnection. A better way to attach the FSR.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></li>
