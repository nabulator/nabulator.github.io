<h1>Openpad Build</h1>

<p>July 2020</p>

<p>Openpad is a open-source design for dance simulation games like <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em>
and <em>Pump It Up</em>. Built with wood, Openpad is a DIY solution to achieve an
arcade-like experience while supporting high customization, outperforming most commercial
home pad solutions in durability, sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. I present my build
below and document my observations and thoughts along the process.</p>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I grew up with an arcade game called Dance Dance Revolution, which was a popular dancing game
simulator from 1997. I played the  home console version on my PlayStation and cycled through
were not well anchored, often drifting during play. Needless to say, the home dance pads paled
drastically when compared to hardened arcade pads, built out of rugged metal frames, with
welded support bars, with 1-inch thick acrylic panels and diffused lights to light up the dance
floor. For most people, purchasing the real arcade game itself was out of the question.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>However, with the development of free-as-in-freedom software simulators such as the legendary
<a href="http://itgpacks.com">Stepmania</a>, along with proliferation of fan-made content, simfiles, which have spread.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Building arcade-style pads from scratch requires some labor but is feasible for an individual
equipped with a modest tool set and skill set. It is a worthwhile endeavor to design work around
functionality, durability and price constraints.</p>

<p><img src="./img/blueshark.jpg" alt="an BlueShark pad with internal parts revealed" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Maybe in the future, I will discuss discuss a teardown of this Blue Shark</p>

<p>There do exist commercial &ldquo;hard&rdquo; dance pads that attempt to replicate arcade pads.
Historically, two of the top-tier products include the Cobalt Flux pads and Blue Shark
pads, both which are no longer manufactured and only available from second-hand markets.
Presently, they are mid-tier products at a mid-range price point but inferior in quality or
sensitivity or maintenance in one way or another. The old foam pads I had from DDRgame
fall into the classification of mid-tier pads. Arcade-style <a href="https://stepmaniax.com">StepmaniaX</a> (SMX) pads are
acquirable for new, although they are pricey (US $1400+shipping) and notoriously out of
stock.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The primary goals for this build is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support High level play (highly sensitive panels)</li>
<li>Support USB host for PC interface</li>
<li>Be as cheap as possible</li>
</ul>


<p>As with any &lsquo;'cost-efficient&rsquo;&lsquo; project, the pad was built up from the materials available
at hand or the cheapest possible materials available at the local hardware store. This
contrasts to a typical engineering workflow in which you begin with a design, then specify
a BOM (Bill of Materials), prototype and iterate.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the primary goals, major design choices followed naturally:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wood is the material of the frame and panels</li>
<li>Analog sensors for software-defined sensitivity</li>
<li>Arduino for microcontroller</li>
</ul>


<p>The source code and documentation needed to reproduce this project is available on the
Openpad project on <a href="https://github.com/nabulator/openpad" title="Github Source">Github</a> originally pioneered by
<a href="https://github.com/finalarcadia">finalarcadia</a>. While finalarcadia made a build for Pump as
well but here I only provide the build for 4 panels. My forked branch includes an
additional PCB design and small changes. My design differs mostly in the use of modular
panels, more sensitive sensors registration and more cost-effective circuit.</p>

<a name="Frame"></a>
<h2>Frame</h2>

<p>Metal is expensive. Metalworking tools &ndash; also expensive.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Wood? Cheap. A used miter saw
from craigslist? $40. My good friend, KJ helped draft some designs in CAD. Inspired by
games Arrow Vortex and Technomotion where all 9 arrows in the 3x3 grid were used in
gameplay, a modular design which each a square would be a self-contained and attachable
unit was designed. The idea was <em>if we wanted</em>, we could re-arrange our sensored panels in
order to play Pump it Up or any other dance game!</p>

<p><img src="./img/panel.svg" height="200" width="30" alt="" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Why not build a universal controller to play all these great games</p>

<p>The material of choice is 2x4 pine lumber, available in any US hardware store for as about as
cheap as wood can get. The measurements in the design were not sized to 2x4 very well,
thus numerous cuts were made to get the wood to shape! A rather generously thick base was
made by gluing four 2x4 beams together. Since 2x4&rsquo;s are meant to be used in constructing
buildings, it has rather rounder edges which I shaved off with the table saw. More wood
scraps! In retrospect, it would have been better to modify the design to reduce the cuts
needed.</p>

<p><img src="./img/pad2018design.jpg" alt="A single module on paper" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Old school DDR and PIU pads used two diagonal screws to secure the panel</p>

<p>Building the individual modules became <strong>very</strong> monotonous and I almost injured myself
twice while zoning out and neglecting safety. Exactly 9 squares brackets with glue butt
joints holding everything together. I was also sloppy with gluing and the panels weren&rsquo;t
completely level with the floor. This would become an issue later when you string the pad
together!</p>

<p>Alignment is a big issue when dealing with modular blocks so I built the alignment blocks
<em>first</em>, then glued then on while they were already coupled using heavy stones and bricks
to clamp.  There are two M6 screws used to hold each edge of the module. Threads were
tapped directly into the thin wooden alignment blocks. This is fine when the pad is flat
but when you hold the pad vertically, it is slightly wobbling at several joints. In my
mind though, disassembly for transporting was an important feature at the time.</p>

<p><img src="./img/padsinglemodule.jpg" alt="A single module with the mounting holes for the sensor" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> The first module made. This one looks <strong>much</strong> better than the rest. Note the mounting
holes for the sensors are tapped for M6 bolts, the same hole size as the sensor</p>

<p><img src="./img/padend.jpg" alt="The final assembled pad" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Attaching the alignment blocks. Notice the use of bricks for clamping. Note the sensors
are tapped straight into the base</p>

<a name="Electronics"></a>
<h2>Electronics</h2>

<a name="Sensors"></a>
<h3>Sensors</h3>

<p>Up to this day, DDR and PIU have used rubber digital sensors that are actuated by a metal
bracket underneath the acrylic panel. The bracket only allows vertical motion to be
registered. Pad maintenance will inevitably require padding the space to change
sensitivity thresholds.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> A new approach by the StepmaniaX team is their use of analog
sensors: load cells or strain gauges that can detect minute tension or compression in the
metal structure itself!  The sensors used in StepmaniaX and this project are beam shaped,
which allows you to mount the panel on the other side of the beam. I used some rubber feet
to hold on the panel and also allows for adjusting of tension.</p>

<p><img src="./img/padloadsensor.jpg" alt="load cell" /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> Testing the load cell circuit</p>

<p>Because the load cell uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_cell#Strain_gauge_load_cell" title="wheatstone bridge">Wheatstone bridge</a>, the output of the signal is in
microvolts, too small to be measured by any microcontroller. We need to use a amplifier to
do the job. Here I use an opamp (which one?) that has four op amps.</p>

<p>Why use a <strong>analog</strong> sensor? Because it allows you to configure arbitrary sensitivity in
software! At least so goes the theory. The panels ended up being a little too sensitive!
The sensors would sometimes register force from a diagonal module due to lateral forces
from the frame&rsquo;s uneven construction. Sometimes, just standing on the center panel can
trigger the other arrows! A temporary fix is to recalibrate and rezero the sensors while
standing on the center panel.</p>

<p>I ordered the load cell sensors from various chinese suppliers through ebay. They&rsquo;re
rather heavy and have a pair of 2x2 M6-threaded holes for mounting.</p>

<a name="Circuits"></a>
<h3>Circuits</h3>

<p>The connections on a bread board were to shaky for me so I went straight to the
protoboard. Screw-in terminals were used for the analog input signals. The internal
resistance of my 200kg sensors are about 50Ω (U-03A9). My DAC has 10 bits in the range of
0-5V giving about 5/2<sup>10</sup> = 4.8 mV sensitivity.</p>

<p>Now we need to talk about the expected pressure we <em>intend</em> to measure. The average person
in the world weighs 62 kg.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Assume that a person when standing, the weight is
distributed evenly between the legs. For the purposes of a dance game, we can also assume
that <strong>less than half</strong> of the weight is used to register a panel. Let&rsquo;s just say I want a
We need sensitivity of 0.1 / 200 * 5V = sensitivity of 100g to register. We need sensitivity
of 0.1 / 200 * 5V = 2.5 mV is the maximum raw sensor threshold. <em>This is clearly not
enough to be picked up by the DAC alone</em>. We need an amplifier to read the signal.</p>

<p>A simple negative-feedback configuration with matched resistors of 1MΩ is used to achieve
a gain of &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="./img/padopamp.png" alt="op amp config" /></p>

<p>Finalarcadia used 4 instrumental op amps (INA125P) which cost ~$6 each on Digikey. I opted
instead for a single LM324 which is only $0.48. Using resistors of 1MΩ gives about a gain
of 200 which is more than enough. Instrumental amps are just  double staged op amps (3 for
one) that offer lower noise itself, but my setup seems to work.</p>

<a name="Of-Noise-and-Entropy"></a>
<h3>Of Noise and Entropy</h3>

<p>Because we&rsquo;re designing an analog circuit we need to minimize our analog noise which our
microcontroller will read! Following standard analog design here wise.
So make sure your sensors are shielded and your 5V clean. Keep wires short as possible.
Another option is to use RC time constant to filter out noise but that could introduce
delay. Design a PCB and use bypass capacitors &ndash; use a function generator and oscilloscope
to verify clean switching in your DAC.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: Actually, I didn&rsquo;t do any of those things and my pad works great.</strong></p>

<a name="Microcontroller"></a>
<h3>Microcontroller</h3>

<p>Arduino is cheap and easy to program. The Arduino Uno (ATmega328 chip) is not powerful
enough to support USB profiling by it&rsquo;s own so you need to reprogram the side ATmega16u2
chip to use the secondary chip as a USB host. Unfortunately, the latency is quite high for
input (~50ms) and debugging a chore. To switch between a keyboard and programmer function,
you need to short a jumper pin and reconnect the USB
every time. A more powerful Arduino Leonardo or even the Pro Micro or Pico is recommended.</p>

<p>It is wise to add LED indicators as debugging via the Serial console can prove annoying.
Nothing like realtime visual feedback.</p>

<p><img src="./img/padbadeletronics.jpg" alt="circuits" /></p>

<p>You see two arduinos here because one of them is just providing power. I think there
shouldn&rsquo;t be a need for this but USB limits to 100mA by default and my op amp may draw up
to 50 mA of power. The arduino board itself also needs 50 mA so it&rsquo;s a close call and I
was definitely having stability issues where only a subset of the op-amps worked when
everything was powered through my laptop. The use of arduino pro micro or nano will have
lower power footprint than the uno.</p>

<a name="Assembly"></a>
<h2>Assembly</h2>

<p><img src="./img/padwithpanels.jpg" alt="assembly" /></p>

<p>The panels were hand cut from a old projector TV. The plastic itself was only 1/32 &ldquo; at
most so I supplemented it with &frac34;&rdquo; of MDF. Alternatively, &frac34;" acrylic
panels or &frac12;" polycarbonate sheets and cut them on a bandsaw. It turns it it actually
hurts to play bare foot.</p>

<a name="Final-Impressions"></a>
<h2>Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Not bad for a first prototype. The whole design needs a reworking but I can perform just
as well if not better than on my old foam pads. Some points taken:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modular design needs more precision</li>
<li>USB  power considerations for circuit (typ. 100mA)</li>
<li>probably should get a safer table saw</li>
<li>Use 4 smaller 20kg sensors instead of one big 200 kg sensor</li>
</ul>


<p>On that last point, I have here a heat map of my Right panel readings. A gallon of water
was placed at 2 inch intervals on a panel. You can probably guess where the tip of the
sensor is residing. It&rsquo;s not perfect. The raw values are taken straight from the DAC in
signed integer from -512 to 512. The pads are of course zeroed so no weight is registered
as zero.</p>

<p><img src="./img/right.png" alt="pad heat map" /></p>

<p>A rebuild is definitely in the planning as I&rsquo;m hoping to create another pad for the
purpose of playing doubles or versus!</p>

<a name="Future-Work"></a>
<h2>Future Work</h2>

<p>There is a lot to do!
New Features I want to add:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lighting (externally powered LED&rsquo;s)</li>
<li>Thinner, flexible transparent panels with better mounting onto frame</li>
<li>Proper PCB</li>
<li>Just use the better arduino</li>
</ol>
